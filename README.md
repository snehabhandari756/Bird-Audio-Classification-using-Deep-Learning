# Bird-Audio-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to classify bird species based on their audio recordings using machine learning techniques. By extracting audio features like MFCCs, the model can identify different bird calls, helping in species recognition and ecological research. Tools used include Python, Librosa, and Scikit-learn.
